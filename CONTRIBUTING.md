## 🚀 How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs or Broken Links
If you find a link that no longer works or a command that is outdated:
1. Open an **Issue**.
2. Describe the problem and provide the correct link/info if you have it.

### Adding New Resources
1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/NewResource`).
3. Add your resource. Please ensure:
    - The tool/site is reputable and safe.
    - You provide a brief description of *why* it is useful.
    - Links are placed in the correct category.
4. **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'Add [Resource Name]'`).
5. **Push** to the branch (`git push origin feature/NewResource`).
6. Open a **Pull Request**.

## 🛠️ Content Guidelines
- **Quality over Quantity:** We don't want 1,000 links; we want the 10 best links for a specific task.
- **No Piracy:** Do not link to cracked software, leaked databases, or copyrighted books.
- **Stay Ethical:** Ensure all resources align with ethical hacking and defensive security practices.

## 📝 Style Guide
- Use clear, concise titles.
- Use Markdown tables where appropriate for readability.
- Keep the directory structure clean (e.g., put scripts in `/Scripts`, not the root).
